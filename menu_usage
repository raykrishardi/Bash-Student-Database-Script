NAME:
menu.sh

DESCRIPTION:
The script presents a menu with the following operations that a script user may choose:
a) Displaying the detailed records of all current students on the standard output
b) Displaying only Student IDs, the GPAs, and the email addresses on the standard output
c) Search for any student’s record and displaying that specific student’s detailed record
d) Add new records to the database file (records.txt)
e) Delete existing records from the database file (records.txt)
f) Update existing records on specific record fields and save changes in the database file (records.txt)

Once the user makes a selection and the selected operation has been completed, the main menu is refreshed and displayed again such that the
script user could make another choice. The program is terminated when the user enter either q or Q.

Appropriate error message (“Invalid option selected. Press Enter to continue...”) will be displayed if the user selects any input other than a, b, c, d, e, f, q or Q.
Appropriate error message (“Selection not entered. Press Enter to continue...”) will be displayed if the user simply hits the Enter key instead of typing in any input.
